    "## 🎯 OBJECTIVE\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the same machine learning model collaboratively across multiple institutions using federated learning, without transferring raw patient data outside local environments. Additionally, incorporate gradient clipping during local training and inject calibrated differential privacy noise into the exchanged model updates. This bounds the sensitivity of each client’s contribution and mitigates risks such as membership inference, model inversion, and reconstruction attacks, thereby providing formal privacy guarantees for the local training data."

    "<p>In healthcare, data is often legally and ethically constrained to remain within institutional or national boundaries. As a result, pooling datasets into a single central location for AI training is frequently infeasible. Yet, developing robust and generalizable models requires access to diverse populations and larger sample sizes than any single institution can typically provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning addresses this tension by allowing each institution to train a model locally and share only model updates rather than raw data. In practice, this requires more than just algorithms: it depends on secure execution environments, identity management, authorization workflows, and auditability across all participating sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, CHORUS provides the secure processing environment and governance controls at each hospital node, while Tune Insight coordinates the federated training process across institutions. Together, they make cross-institution AI development operationally feasible while respecting data sovereignty and regulatory constraints.\n",
