# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Scientific research, particularly in fields like medicine and neuroscience, requires powerful computational tools and access to sensitive data. Researchers often face significant challenges in:

-   **Setting up complex software environments**: Many scientific tools have complex dependencies and are difficult to install and configure.
-   **Ensuring security and compliance**: Working with sensitive patient data requires a secure, auditable environment that complies with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
-   **Reproducibility**: It is often difficult to reproduce the exact software environment of a research project, which is a cornerstone of the scientific method.
-   **Access to high-performance computing**: Many analyses, especially in neuroimaging and AI, require significant computational resources, including GPUs, which may not be readily available to all researchers.

## Product Vision

CHORUS aims to solve these problems by providing a unified, secure, and easy-to-use platform for scientific research. It is a "research environment as a service" that abstracts away the complexity of infrastructure management and software configuration.

### User Experience Goals

-   **Seamless Access**: Researchers can access a full suite of pre-installed and configured tools through a simple web interface.
-   **"Bring your own tools"**: The platform is extensible, allowing research groups to add their own custom tools to the environment.
-   **Collaboration**: The platform should facilitate collaboration between researchers by providing a shared and consistent environment.
-   **Secure by Default**: All data is handled within a secure environment, giving researchers peace of mind and ensuring regulatory compliance.
