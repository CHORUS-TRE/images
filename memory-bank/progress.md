# Progress

## What Works

-   The core structure of the Memory Bank has been created.
-   Initial analysis of the project structure and key applications has been performed.
-   The `.cursor/rules/` have been updated for consistency.

## What's Left to Build

-   The initial Memory Bank needs to be reviewed and validated by the user.
-   The documentation for each individual application needs to be created or expanded.
-   The server-side components of the CHORUS platform need to be investigated and documented.

## Current Status

The initial documentation and discovery phase is complete. The Memory Bank is now ready for review and feedback.

## Known Issues

-   The Memory Bank is based on inference from the codebase and has not yet been validated by a human.
-   There may be inaccuracies or missing information in the generated documentation.
