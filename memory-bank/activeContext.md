# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on reviewing and validating the initial Memory Bank with the user. This will ensure that the documentation is accurate and provides a solid foundation for future work.

## Recent Changes

-   The core Memory Bank files have been created and populated with initial content based on an analysis of the codebase.
-   The `.cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc` file has been updated to standardize the location of project intelligence.
-   A new `projectIntelligence.md` file has been created in `.cursor/rules/`.

## Next Steps

-   Gather feedback from the user on the accuracy and completeness of the Memory Bank.
-   Refine the documentation based on user feedback.
-   Begin a more detailed exploration of the individual applications within the CHORUS platform to create more granular documentation.
